This is a code repository for connecting to the foursquare API (https://developers.facebook.com/) via Oauth2 and Javascript. This is meant for academic uses only. I make no pretense about code quality but you are welcome to use it if you feel it might be useful.

This is part of an academic project at Cornell University (http://idl.cornell.edu/projects/facebook-non-use/)
